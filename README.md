# Modules for Teaching Bayes to Diverse Audiences
Motivation:

Although most analysts were taught from the frequentist statistical perspective, many new and exciting statistical methods are being developed from a Bayesian perspective. It is important for analysts of diverse educational backgrounds to be familiar with ideas from the Bayesian perspective so as to interpret results from Bayesian analyses and perhaps even apply these analyses themselves. 

Summary:

To this end, we developed a set of four hands-on modules for building familiarity and proficiency in Bayesian skills. These modules were designed to present complex statistical ideas to audiences of diverse educational backgrounds. After thoughtful consideration of user-friendly Bayesian software, we chose the R package brms (BÃ¼rkner, 2017) for implementing the Bayesian analyses presented in these modules.
